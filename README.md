### **Website Usage**

##### **Getting Started**

In order to use HoosThere, you must first login using your Google credentials through your @virginia.edu email address. The Google Authenticator module will navigate you to NetBadge where you will be prompted to go through the standard UVA two-factor authentication.

Once you are logged in,  we recommend that you update your profile by clicking on the "Edit" button under profile information. Here you can indicate various majors/minors, classes you have taken, and your privacy preference which makes your profile unsearchable by others using the app if checked. You can navigate through HoosThere by clicking on the different categories at the top of the screen. Your dashboard is the central hub from which you can view and edit all of your profile information, see recent posts, and perform site-wide keyword searches. 

##### **Connect with Peers**

To connect with other UVA students, navigate to the appropriate page by clicking on the User button at the top of the screen. From there, you can search the HoosThere community, send others messages, and view your peer's profiles. The search feature will search through all the fields that a user has and will return the appropriate results based on your criteria. 

If you decide to send a message to a peer, you will need to click the "Send Message" button under the user you want to send a message to. You will be redirected to a page where you can type your message and send it. Under the Messages tab, you can view the messages you have sent to others as well as any messages you have received. 

##### **View and Create Posts**

Click on the Bulletin tab to view a centralized list of all user posts. Each post contains a tag which can be clicked to view more posts from the same category. The search bar under the Bulletin tab can also be used to explore posts based on the postâ€™s author, its category, or any word that might appear in the body or header of a post. 

Create a post by simply navigating to the Bulletin page, clicking on the "Create a Post" button, selecting the category of your post from the supplies list, and entering the title and contents of your post. Your post time and category will automatically be displayed, in addition to your username.
